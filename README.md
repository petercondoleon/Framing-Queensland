***NOT ALL OF THESE ARE A PRIORITY - IF YOU CAN DO MORE THAN ONE OF THESE AND
ARE NOT SURE ON WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT TO DO, ASK IN THE GROUP CHAT****
TODO:
- Refine any existing PNG and SVG files.
- Correct the SVGs
- Sort SVGs and PNGs with consistent names and remove any older/not being
  planned on being used.
- do roundover.html css and transition from off page to on page
  (like loading screen but reverse), this can be called from the end of the
  timer (width == maxwidth).
- fix instructions page showing up on the home screen when rescaling
- ensure that regardless of the image loaded in the game page it cannot exceed a
  certain height and the game.php cannot be scrolled on desktop
- Ajax Call on keywords, store in a variable
- tagging text field (like Facebook, Stack overflow, etc, tagging).
- Store users guesses in a variable
- determine scoring system and pass both user and API guess and return score.
- fix all commenting on JS code (if nothing is returned don't use return)
- ensure all JS is on the correct JS file.
- ensure all CSS is on the correct page.
- center FQ loading symbol on homepage
- improve homepage animation for images
- @Jayden reduced the timer interval back to 1 (looks less smooth but at 0.5 it
  was lagging on  some systems). If we want to smooth out the timer we can look
  at implementing the jquery function called slideToggle()
  http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/, or an alternative.
- Create a basic speech flow for our presentation
- Complete report for PART C
- Design and make posters for presentation (pitch design to group before making)
- build wiki for code (will go nicely in report but requires above the
  commenting to be finalised).
- **DATASET SIZE REDUCED TO 6 and keyword API set to none for now to limit
  accidental usage! Ignore the invalid credentials error and use the dummy
  returned keywords for other testing purposes!**
