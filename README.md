TODO:
- Create a main logo for the website that can be scaled on a 1:1 scale and the
  width = height in pixels. The logo needs to have transparency and still be
  readable in a silhouette form (for converting later on). This logo is used
  for the page icon, etc. (I named it "webpage.png" for now)
- Convert main logo to favicons (I can do this after the logo is done as I have
experience in this - @Jayden)
- Refine any existing PNG and SVG files.
- Sort SVGs and PNGs with consistent names and remove any older/not being
  planned on being used.
