                    <h2>What is Framing Queensland?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Framing Queensland is a guessing game that takes advantage of dynamically fetched images from SLQâ€™s Picture Queensland dataset to become the medium for guessing. A round in the game initially blurs an image which is then slowly made clearer as a timer counts down. The goal is to guess as many words related to the blurred image as possible before the timer runs out and the image completely de-blurs. Points are scored in each round based on how user guesses match in similarity to guesses made by an AI through use of Clarifai image recognition API.
